# LexiParse

> A powerful, modular compiler framework designed for efficient lexical analysis and parsing.

## 🚀 Overview
LexiParse is a robust compiler framework built to handle the entire compilation pipeline—from tokenizing source code to parsing and generating an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Whether you're building a custom language or experimenting with compiler design, LexiParse offers a solid foundation for your projects.

## 🔍 Features
- **Lexical Analysis**: Efficient tokenization engine for rapid processing.
- **Syntax Parsing**: Flexible parser supporting multiple grammar structures.
- **Error Handling**: Clear and informative error reporting.
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend with custom rules and transformations.
- **AST Generation**: Automatically generates abstract syntax trees for further compilation stages.

# Navigate to the project directory
cd LexiParse

# Install dependencies (if any)
npm install  # or use pip, cargo, etc., depending on the language
```

## 💻 Usage
Here's a basic example of how to run LexiParse:

```bash
# Run the compiler on a sample file
lexiparse compile example.lp
```
