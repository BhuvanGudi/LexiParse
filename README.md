Sure! Here's the updated information including the NASM setup and the README file content:

### NASM Setup

To set up NASM (Netwide Assembler) on your machine, follow these steps:

1. **Download NASM**:

   - Visit the official NASM website: [https://nasm.us/](https://nasm.us/)
   - Download the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS).

2. **Install NASM**:

   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
   - For **Windows** users, you can also refer to the installation guide on Stack Overflow: [How to add a folder to the PATH environment variable in Windows 10](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44272416/how-to-add-a-folder-to-path-environment-variable-in-windows-10-with-screensho).

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:

   - After installing NASM, you need to add its installation directory to your system’s PATH variable to run it from the command line.
   - Follow the steps in the Stack Overflow link above to add the NASM directory to your PATH.

4. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command to check if NASM was installed correctly:
     ```bash
     nasm -v
     ```
   - If successful, it will display the NASM version.

# LexiParse

> A powerful, modular compiler framework designed for efficient lexical analysis and parsing.

## 🚀 Overview

LexiParse is a robust compiler framework built to handle the entire compilation pipeline—from tokenizing source code to parsing and generating an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Whether you're building a custom language or experimenting with compiler design, LexiParse offers a solid foundation for your projects.

## 🔍 Features

- **Lexical Analysis**: Efficient tokenization engine for rapid processing.
- **Syntax Parsing**: Flexible parser supporting multiple grammar structures.
- **Error Handling**: Clear and informative error reporting.
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend with custom rules and transformations.
- **AST Generation**: Automatically generates abstract syntax trees for further compilation stages.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/LexiParse.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd LexiParse

# Install dependencies (if any)
npm install  # or use pip, cargo, etc., depending on the language
```

## 💻 Usage

Here's a basic example of how to run LexiParse:

```bash
# Run the compiler on a sample file
lexiparse compile example.lp
```
